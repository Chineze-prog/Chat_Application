## Description

This is a chat server-client app similar to Discord's setup. Multiple clients can connect to a chat server and send messages to other clients connected to that server.

## How To Start My Code:

To start the server, run "python server.py." The hostname and port will be provided/printed out in the terminal.

To start the client, run "python client.py" and first enter the server hostname, then the server port (provided by the server), and then a username that isn't being used.

To run the bash file: run "./run_clients.sh" and enter the number of test clients you want to run
